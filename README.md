## Statistic: 

### P-Value
This is relevant for hypothesis tests. The p-value helps you determine the significance of the results. 

*Hypothesis Tests* are used to verify a claim made about a population. The claims that is on trial is called the *Null Hypothesis*.

The *Alternative Hypothesis* is the one you would believe if the *Null Hypothesis* is untrue. 

The **P-Value** is a number between 0 and 1, where the smaller the value is, the stronger the evidence **against** the *Null Hypothesis*
